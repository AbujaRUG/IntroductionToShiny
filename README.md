# Introduction to Shiny Webinars

Shiny is a package from RStudio that can be used to build interactive web pages with R. This means that all of Râ€™s extensive (and extensible) data analysis and visualization features can be used in the shiny app.
We can run the apps locally, within R Studio, make them standalone - either by deploying them to a Shiny Server, or to a hosting service, such as https://shinyapps.io, or include them in a Markdown document.

This tutorial takes a step-by-step approach on how to create and host a Shiny application using RStudion.
